Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git changes the directory you are in into a repository, adding a hidden .git folder which contains the history.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to decide which files in the working directory will go into the repository.


Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: Add files in logical groups to the staging area rather than all at once.


Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: When you plan to make different versions, for example to add an experimental feature or try a different implementation.


Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A: Pretty obvious, right? You can see what other branches there are, where they split off from master etc.


Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A: It takes the changes made by both branches from their last common ancestor and combines them. We represent it this way because the separate branches rejoin when they are merged.
