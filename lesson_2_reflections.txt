Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git changes the directory you are in into a repository, adding a hidden .git folder which contains the history.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to decide which files in the working directory will go into the repository.
